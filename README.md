Hello! As promised, Stackon is live on: https://stackon.herokuapp.com
Reason for failed deployment was becuase my slug was too large as it was over 1GB (2.7Gb to be precise) so heroku remote declined deployment at last stage. It was large because i built a neural network dapp with so many dependencies. 
Please do enjoy and relay your feedbacks on devpost via comment section.

Best.
